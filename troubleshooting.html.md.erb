                  Errors containing:

                  <li><code>DBSubnetQuotaExceededFault</code></li>
                  </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cause</td>
                <td>
                  There is a resource quota for AWS called Subnets per DB subnet group that establishes the maximum
                  number of subnets per DB subnet group to each supported region to 20.
                  <br>
                  When operators/developers do not supply an existing subnet group in the plan or provision time,
                  the CSB creates a subnet group. The CSB adds all the present subnets in the specified VPC
                  to the new subnet group. For example, letâ€™s say the operator:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specifies a VPC with 25 subnets through the tile.</li>
                        <li>Does not specify a DB subnet group in the plan.</li>
                        <li>Does not specify a DB subnet group at provisioning time.</li>
                    </ul>
                  Then the CSB creates a DB subnet group and adds <strong>all</strong> subnets, 25 in this example,
                  to the DB subnet group. Hence, this operation breaches the AWS resource quota.

                <td>
                    Create a custom DB subnet group through the AWS console and add the desired subnets for RDS
                    instances to use. Then use the DB subnet group name as a plan or provision parameter.

                  <li><code>permission denied for table</code></li>

            </tr>

                <td>Cause</td>
                <td>
                  The Cloud Foundry binding model implies that multiple bindings can query
                  or edit the same tables. This is particularly useful for rotating credentials where
                  unbind and bind operations are needed. Additionally, the broker does not support
                  creating bindings with different levels of access to the objects created. This means that
                  all bindings need the same access to all objects and can query and edit them regardless
                  of what binding created them in the first place.
                  This conflicts with the PostgreSQL permission model, where the user that created an object is the owner
                  and is the only one who can edit tables and query them, unless permission is explicitly granted to other
                  roles.
                  This applies for bindings and service keys.

                  <br>
                  Specifically, the following issues can happen:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Binding A not having access to a table that binding B created, when binding B created the table after binding A was created.</li>
                        <li>Binding A cannot read tables created by binding B until a new binding C is created.</li>
                        <li>Binding A cannot change tables created by binding B until binding B is deleted (unbound from its app).</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Solution</td>
                <td>
                All the database users created when binding and creating service keys with Tanzu Cloud Service Broker for AWS are assigned the role `binding_user_group`. This implies
                they all have access to tables created by the `binding_user_group` role.
                Creating any objects with the `binding_user_group` role instead of the binding user resolves any of the issues mentioned here.
                You can achieve this by running `SET ROLE binding_user_group` before any other instruction in the SQL script that creates your object or framework performing database migrations.

                If you have issues with tables already created, you must either:

                1. Unbind the application that has created the objects and bind again (or delete the service key that has created the objects).
                This is because when unbinding, Tanzu Cloud Service Broker for AWS automatically transfers ownership of existing objects to the `binding_user_group` role.

                2. Manually transfer ownership to the `binding_user_group` with the following statement "ALTER TABLE tab_name OWNER TO binding_user_group;".
                You must run this statement after logging in to the database with the credentials from the binding/service key used to create the objects.

                3. If you only need other bindings to perform data operations, you can create new bindings for interacting with these objects.
                This is because Tanzu Cloud Service Broker for AWS assigns permissions to all existing tables whenever a new binding is created. However, this new binding does
                not have permissions to perform DDL operations until points 1. or 2. are implemented.
