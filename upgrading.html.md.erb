title: Upgrading Cloud Service Broker for AWS
owner: Cloud Service Broker
---

This topic describes how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id="upgrade-to-1-2-0"></a> Upgrading to v1.2.0

<%= vars.product_short %> uses Terraform internally to manage the deployment of service instances.
Terraform was updated from v0.12 to v1.1.
As a result, there is an upgrade process that must be performed on every service instance so that
<%= vars.product_short %> can continue to manage it.

Back up service instances and review the known issues before upgrading to v1.2.0.
For more information, see [Known Issues with Upgrading to v1.2.0](#known-issues).

### <a id="s3-bucket"></a> Amazon S3 Bucket

Amazon S3 bucket is no longer in beta and can be used in production.

#### <a id="s3-old-plans"></a> Restoring brokerpak-provided plans

From this version onwards, plans are no longer provided with the brokerpak.
If you have S3 bucket instances that you want to maintain, you must add previously provided plans
through the tile.
For more information, see [Add previously provided pre-configured plans](reference/aws-s3.html.md.erb#old-plans).

If you instead want to delete all previously created S3 bucket service instances, you must delete
them before upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> to v1.2.0.

To remove the instances from the broker, run:

```console
cf delete-service SERVICE-NAME
```

To remove instances from Cloud Foundry, but retain them in the IaaS, run:

```console
cf purge-service-instance
```

#### <a id="s3-custom-plans"></a> Changing custom plans

If you have custom plans already configured, you might need to change the configuration because the
new `boc_object_ownership` property defaults to `BucketOwnerEnforced`, which deactivates ACLs.

To compensate for `boc_object_ownership`, add the property to your plan.

For example:

```json
  {
      "name": "public-read",
      "id": "04317eaa-11ac-4c5f-b77f-eb005fe977fe",
      "description": "Public-read S3 bucket",
      "display_name": "Public Read",
      "acl": "public-read",
      "boc_object_ownership": "ObjectWriter"
  }
```

For more information about the <code>boc_object_ownership</code> and <code>acl</code> properties,
see [Amazon S3 Bucket](reference/aws-s3.html.md.erb).

### <a id="rds-postgres"></a> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is no longer in beta and can be used in production.

#### <a id="rds-postgres-old-plans"></a> Restoring brokerpak-provided plans

From this version onwards, plans are no longer provided with the brokerpak.
If you have Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL instances that you want to maintain, you must add previously
provided plans through the tile.
For more information, see
[Add previously provided pre-configured plans](reference/aws-postgres.html.md.erb#old-plans).

If you instead want to delete all previously created Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL service instances,
you must delete them before upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> to v1.2.0.

To remove the instances from the broker, run:

```console
cf delete-service SERVICE-NAME
```

To remove instances from Cloud Foundry, but retain them in the IaaS, run:

```console
cf purge-service-instance
```

#### <a id="rds-postgres-custom-plans"></a> Changing custom plans

If you have custom plans already configured for PostgreSQL, you must change the configuration.
This is because the new `storage_type` property is `io1` by default, which attempts to move all
service instances into a new storage type from the general purpose (gp2) type that they are on
currently.

To ensure that no unintended changes happen to your existing instances, add the `storage_type`
property to your plan. For example:

```json
  {
    "name": "my-custom-plan",
    "id": "dd448d6e-1d71-11ed-9974-77a0c9ef0141",
    "description": "Custom plan",
    "cores": 2,
    "storage_gb": 5,
    "postgres_version": 11,
    "storage_type": "gp2"
  }
```

### <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues with Upgrading to v1.2.0

Upgrading from v1.0.0 is not possible. This is due to a change in the internal structure of the
Terraform configuration files that causes upgrades for all services to fail.

If a `csb-aws-dynamodb` service was created with v1.0.1 or earlier, upgrading fails.
This is due to an issue that was fixed in later versions where the property `table_name` was
incorrectly named `tabel_name`.
Any updates to the service can cause a failure because the property key changed in subsequent versions.

## <a id="pre-upgrade-procedure"></a> Pre-upgrade procedure

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>Before upgrading, it is crucial to perform the checks suggested in this section.</span>
  Failure to can cause the upgrade process to fail and leave the broker unable to manage your instances.
</p>

* **Check if services are up-to-date**
  Execute the command:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -check-up-to-date
   ```

  This command checks whether all services provided by the specified broker are up-to-date.
  An instance is considered not up-to-date if it is pending upgrade, or if it is an orphaned service instance.

* **Check for orphaned service instances**
  For greater granularity, you can specifically check only orphan service instances by running this command:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -check-deactivated-plans
   ```

  This checks for any service instances still using plans that have been deactivated.
  For more information, see [Managing orphaned service instances documentation](./managing_orphaned_service_instances.html.md.erb).


## <a id="procedure"></a> Upgrade procedure

To upgrade the <%= vars.product_short %> to a later version:

>Review the `deploy-all` errand logs in the change log to verify that
   no errors occurred when upgrading instances.

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Before you stage the new tile version,
   [verify that all service instances are up to date](#upgrade-instances).

2. Download the new version of <%= vars.product_short %> from
   [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/cloud-service-broker-aws/).

3. Stage and configure the tile by following the instructions in
   [Installing with AWS](installing-with-aws.html.md.erb).

4. Make all the changes described in [Upgrading to v1.4](#upgrading-specifics).

5. Verify that your configuration complies with the
   [important notes about upgrading service instances](#upgrade-notes),
   especially regarding upgrading all instances to the config, plans,
   and beta offerings.

6. Go to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

7. Click **Review Pending Changes** and then click **Apply Changes**.

8. Review the `deploy-all` errand logs for any errors created because of the upgrade instances task.

## <a id="upgrade-instances"></a> Verify that service instances are up to date before upgrading the tile

Service instances that haven't been upgraded with one version of the tile might not be upgradable by
a later version.
For this reason, verify that there are no service instances pending upgrade before staging the new version of the tile.

You can see whether there are instances with a pending upgrade by reviewing the `deploy-all` errand
log for <%= vars.product_short %>. Alternatively, you can
[ensure all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in](#checking-cli-plugin)
and the `-dry-run` flag, which outputs the list of instances pending upgrade.

You can see whether there are instances with a pending upgrade by using the CLI plug-in.
For more information, see [ensuring all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in](#checking-cli-plugin).

If you find instances that are pending upgrade, follow the upgrading instructions for your current
version.

### <a id="upgrade-notes"></a> Important notes about upgrading service instances

Before you start upgrading service instances, see the following notes:

- **Selecting the Upgrade all services check box:**

  If the **Upgrade all services** check box is not selected, service instances are not upgraded
  during installation. These instances become unmanageable by the broker.
  Any operations on that instance, such as update, bind, unbind, or delete, are blocked
  until you run the upgrade task.
  You can run the upgrade task at any time before upgrading the product to a later version.
  See [Upgrade All Service Instances configuration](installing-with-aws.html.md.erb#upgrade-all-config) for information
  about how to configure this task.
  Alternatively, run the upgrade at a later stage by using the [CLI plug-in](#upgrading-cli-plugin).

- **Selecting the Enable Beta offerings check box:**

  If the **Enable Beta offerings** check box is not selected when applying changes, instances from
  those service offerings are not upgraded. These instances become unmanageable by the broker.
  Ensure that the **Enable Beta offerings** check box is selected if you have instances from those
  offerings you intend to keep updated.

- **Deleting custom plans:**

  If you delete custom plans before upgrading all instances, instances from these plans are not
  upgraded. These instances become unmanageable by the broker. Delete plans after upgrading all
  instances, or see [Release Notes for Cloud Service Broker for AWS](release-notes.html.md.erb) and
  [Upgrading to v1.4](#upgrading-specifics) to prevent conflicting upgrades.

- **Only upgrade the tile after all service instances are up to date:**

  You can run the upgrade all instances task as many times as needed.
  If you prefer, run the upgrade all instances task by using the cf CLI instead of,
  or in addition to, running it through the tile.
  Failure to upgrade one or more instances does not cause the tile installation to fail.
  Review the `deploy all` errand logs to verify that all instances have upgraded.

### <a id="checking-cli-plugin"></a> Verify that all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in

To verify that no instances are pending upgrade:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices
   plugin](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices) on Cloud.
1. Follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository to perform a `check-up-to-date` command.

   `check-up-to-date` example:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -check-up-to-date
   ```

   These command provide a list, from enabled plans, of instances that are pending upgrades, and a list of
   orphaned service instances that belong to deactivated plans.
   Manage all the instances listed before attempting a tile upgrade.

### <a id="upgrading-cli-plugin"></a> Upgrade instances through the CLI plug-in

To run the cf CLI plug-in:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices
   plugin](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices) on Cloud Foundry.
1. To run the upgrade, follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository.

   For example:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME
   ```

Run the CLI plug-in with the `-dry-run` flag before applying the service instance upgrade to find
out which instances are pending upgrade.

## <a id="upgrading-specifics"></a> Upgrading to 1.4

### <a id="aurora-postgres"></a> Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition

The following sections describe changes for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition.

#### <a id="aurora-postgres-ssl"></a> Unsecured connections from the broker are no longer supported

<%= vars.product_short %> connections to Aurora PostgreSQL instances must use TLS encryption.
For bind and unbind to work, the AWS certificate bundle must be installed in <%=
vars.ops_manager %>.
