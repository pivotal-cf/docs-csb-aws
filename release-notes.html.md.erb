### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

- **Turning on query logging for your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance:**
  You can now turn on query logging by setting `parameter_group_name` with a pre-created Parameter Group that fulfills
  requirements for PostgreSQL log exports and the property `enable_export_postgresql_logs`.
  By default, query logging is deactivated.
  When activated, the default number of log retention days is 30. You can configure this property:
    - `cloudwatch_postgresql_log_group_retention_in_days`: This is used in conjunction with `enable_export_postgresql_logs`.
    If provided, it sets the retention days for the log group containing the RDS postgresql logs.

- **Turning on upgrade logging for your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance:**
  You can now turn on upgrade logging by setting the property `enable_export_upgrade_logs`.
  The upgrade log group only receives logs once a major upgrade happens, in other words, when the `pgupgrade` module is invoked.
  By default, upgrade logging is deactivated.
  When activated, the default number of log retention days is 30. You can configure this property:
  - `cloudwatch_upgrade_log_group_retention_in_days`: This is used in conjunction with `enable_export_upgrade_logs`.
    If provided, it sets the retention days for the log group containing the RDS upgrade logs.

- **Encrypting CloudWatch logs:**
  New property exposed that allows you to encrypt the logs generated when activate postgresql or upgrade logs. 
  The property `cloudwatch_log_groups_kms_key_id` is used in conjunction with
  `enable_export_postgresql_logs` or `enable_export_upgrade_logs`.
  If provided, it sets the KSM key to use for encrypting the CloudWatch log group that is created for the RDS postgresql and upgrade logs.

#### Amazon RDS for MSSQL

- **The Amazon RDS for MSSQL (Beta) service:**

  An experimental foundation was added for development and test purposes only.
  For more information about how to create and manage this service, see
  [Amazon RDS for MSSQL (Beta)](reference/aws-mssql.html.md.erb).

- **Basic properties exposed:**

  Properties such as engine, MSSQL version, storage capacity, database name, instance name, VPC ID,
  VPC security group IDs, and instance class are now configurable at plan creation or instance
  operations. Moreover, you can define your own RDS subnet group when creating a plan or instance.

  For more information about how to create and manage this service, see
  [Amazon RDS for MSSQL (Beta)](reference/aws-mssql.html.md.erb).

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

## General

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/csb/timeout-resolved' %>

- **Fixes incorrect documentation links in Apps Manager:**

  In Apps Manager, there is a link pointing to the documentation for each service. The links pointed
  to old versions of the documentation. From now on, the links point to a generic landing page where
  you can find links to every product version and, from there, navigate to the service you want.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

#### Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

- **Inconsistent design in the format accepted in the `redis_version` property:**

  If the version is 6 or later you can set the major and minor version, such as `6.2`.
  Alternatively, you can leave the minor version unspecified in order to use the latest
  version at creation time. For example, `6.x`.
  For `7.x` versions, however, you must specify the minor version. For example, `7.0`.
