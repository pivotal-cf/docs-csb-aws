<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

These are release notes for <%= vars.product_full %>.


##<a id="1-0-2"></a> v1.0.2

**Release Date:** April 8, 2021

### Resolved Issues
This release has the following fixes:

* **Secret issue in test logs:** <%= vars.product_short %> no longer emits secrets in test logs.
* **AWS DynamoDB parameter typo:** AWS DynamoDB parameter `tabel_name` typo is fixed and now reads `table_name`.
* **PostgreSQL permissions:** Postgres now has the correct permissions to generate database schemas.

### Known Issue

This release has the following issue:

* **PostgreSQL instances cannot be moved to smaller plans:** Because of a limitation with Amazon RDS for
  PostgreSQL, instance plans cannot be changed to smaller plans.
  For example, when using a `cf update-service -p` command.
  This restriction also applies to subsumed PostgreSQL instances.
  Updates to a PostgreSQL instance fail if they attempt an update that decreases `storage_gb`.
  For information about decreasing the total provisioned storage size of an Amazon RDS database instance,
  see the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-db-storage-size/).
