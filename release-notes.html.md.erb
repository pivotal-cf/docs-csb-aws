### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **New property `sse_extra_kms_key_ids`**:
  You can now specify a comma-separated list of custom KMS key ids which bindings can use to encrypt and decrypt objects in the bucket.  
  This property is also useful if you need to rotate the `sse_default_kms_key`.  
  For more information about these properties and how to use them, see the [Parameters section for Amazon S3 Bucket](reference/aws-s3.html.md.erb#parameters).
- **Run-in header:** Description.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

- **Using a custom KMS key for object encryption:**
  Previosuly, when trying to encrypt an object with a custom KMS key it would fail with an `AccessDenied` error.  
  When a custom KMS key was used as the `sse_default_kms_key` this completely prevented uploading encrypted objects.  
  Rest assured that this bug didn't cause any objects to be uploaded accidentally unencrypted. However, you may want  
  to review the encryption settings for your instances as you may want to harness the new property `sse_extra_kms_key_ids`.  
  For more information about these properties and how to use them, see the [Parameters section for Amazon S3 Bucket](reference/aws-s3.html.md.erb#parameters).
- **Run-in header:** Description.
