New features and changes in this release:

#### Amazon RDS for MSSQL

- **Database encryption:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances are encrypted with an AWS managed encryption key. Alternatively, it's possible to
  provide a custom KMS encryption key ARN, or to disable encryption altogether.
  For more details on encrypting a database instance, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html#Overview.Encryption.Enabling).
  Do not confuse this with [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.SQLServer.Options.TDE.html).

- **Storage type and IOPS:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances use io1 with up to 3000 operations per second (IOPS).
  Alternatively, it's possible to specify different storage type and iops at creation time or modify them after creation.
  For more information check [Amazon RDS DB instance storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html).
