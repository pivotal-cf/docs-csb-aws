**Release Date:** MMM DD, YYYY

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:

- **Amazon RDS MySQL service:**
  - **the default storage type is now set as 'io1' (provisioned IOPS SSD):** Previously the default used
    'gp2' (general purpose SSD).
    Users who previously had custom plans should add the property `"storage_type":"gp2"` to the plan definition,
    to ensure the storage type is not amended on any update.
    As part of this work, the default storage size has also been increased to 100GB, as this is the smallest
    storage supported by the 'io1' storage type.
    For more information, see [Changing custom plans](upgrading.html.md.erb#rds-mysql-custom-plans).


### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **Amazon RDS MySQL service:**
  - **MySQL version is no longer restricted:** Previously the parameter `mysql_version` was restricted
    to a list of supported values.
    You can now choose the version you want when creating a plan.
    To view the supported versions, see the
    [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.Supported).

  - **The properties for setting the maintenance window are nullables:** Previously these properties
    used default string values to determine whether the final value of the maintenance window must be
    configured or not.
    These properties are now null to make code easier to read and maintain long-term.

  - **Exposed Automated Backups:** Automated backups can now be scheduled through `backup_window`.
    By default, automated backups are disabled. This feature can be customized through the
    following properties:
    - `delete_automated_backups`: Delete backups when deleting the instance, defaults to true.
    - `copy_tags_to_snapshot`: Copy all instance tags to snapshots, defaults to true.
    - `backup_retention_period`: The number of days (1-35) for which automatic backups are kept. Set the value to 0 to disable automated backups.

  - **`db_name` property is no longer updatable:** Updating the db_name property results in a destructive
    action as the db is recreated by Terraform. This change fails the update quickly for improved user experience.

  - **`deletion_protection` is configurable and updatable:** New added property that allows you to configure the
    deletion protection for the MySQL database in both the provisioning and the updating phase of the instance.
    By default the protection is disabled.

  - **`storage_type` and `iops` are configurable and updatable:** New added property that allows you to configure the
    storage type in both the provisioning and the updating phase of the instance.
    In addition to this, if using the provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) storage type, then the 'iops' value can
    also be defined through the property "iops". The default `storage_type` is `io1` if none is defined.

  - **Added deprecation warning to `cores` property** The `cores` property is now deprecated and optional if you use
    the `instance_class` property. This `cores` is a translation layer to the `instance_class` property. The DB
    instance class determines the computation and memory capacity of an Amazon RDS DB instance. The DB instance
    class you need depends on your processing power and memory requirements, so we recommend using instance_class
    to adjust the DB instance to your requirements.
