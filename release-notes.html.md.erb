### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### Amazon RDS for MSSQL

- **Database encryption:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances are encrypted with an AWS managed encryption key. Alternatively, it's possible to
  provide a custom KMS encryption key ARN, or to deactivate encryption altogether.
  For more details on encrypting a database instance, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html#Overview.Encryption.Enabling).
  Do not confuse this with [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.SQLServer.Options.TDE.html).

- **Storage autoscaling:** By default, all new MSSQL instances are created with
  storage autoscaling deactivated. Alternatively, it's possible to enable it by
  setting `max_allocated_storage` to a value greater than `storage_gb` at
  creation time or by updating the instance. For more information, see [Managing
  capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage
  autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling)
  in the AWS documentation.

- **Storage type and IOPS:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances use io1 with up to 3000 operations per second (IOPS).
  Alternatively, it's possible to specify different storage type and IOPS at creation time or modify them after creation.
  For more information, see [Amazon RDS DB instance
  storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html)
  in the AWS documentation.

  - **Deletion protection:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances are created with deletion protection deactivated.
  Alternatively, it's possible to enable deletion protection at creation time or by updating the instance.

  - **Publicly accessible:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances are created with `publicly_accessible: false` for increased security.
  Alternatively, it's possible to set `publicly_accessible: true` at creation time or by updating the instance.
  Note that setting `publicly_accessible: true` is not sufficient for making the database instance public.
  For more information, see [Unreachable publicly accessible database](troubleshooting.html#publicly-accessible-unreachable).

  - **Option group:**
  An existing DB option group can now be associated through `option_group_name`.
  MSSQL offers additional features such as SQL Server Audit, Transparent Data Encryption, etc. which are configured using an option group.
  For more information check [Amazon RDS options for the Microsoft SQL Server database engine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.SQLServer.Options.html).
