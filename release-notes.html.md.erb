  VPC security group IDs, and instance class are now configurable at plan creation or instance
  operations. Moreover, you can define your own RDS subnet group when creating a plan or instance.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/csb/timeout-resolved' %>

- **Fixes incorrect documentation links in Apps Manager:**

  In Apps Manager, there is a link pointing to the documentation for each service. The links pointed
  to old versions of the documentation. From now on, the links point to a generic landing page where
  you can find links to every product version and, from there, navigate to the service you want.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

#### Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

- **Inconsistent design in the format accepted in the `redis_version` property:**

  If the version is 6 or later you can set the major and minor version, such as `6.2`.
  Alternatively, you can leave the minor version unspecified in order to use the latest
  version at creation time. For example, `6.x`.
  For `7.x` versions, however, you must specify the minor version. For example, `7.0`.
