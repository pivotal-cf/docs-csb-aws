### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- **MySQL version is no longer restricted:** Previously the parameter `mysql_version` was restricted
  to a list of supported values.
  You can now choose the version you want when creating a plan.
  To view the supported versions, see the
  [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.html#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt.Supported).

- **The properties for setting the maintenance window are nullables:** Previously these properties
  used default string values to determine whether the final value of the maintenance window must be
  configured or not.
  These properties are now null to make code easier to read and maintain long-term.

- **Exposed Automated Backups:** Automated backups can now be scheduled through `backup_window`.
  By default, automated backups are disabled. This feature can be customized through the
  following properties:
  - `delete_automated_backups`: Delete backups when deleting the instance, defaults to true.
  - `copy_tags_to_snapshot`: Copy all instance tags to snapshots, defaults to true.
  - `backup_retention_period`: The number of days (1-35) for which automatic backups are kept. Set the value to 0 to disable automated backups.

- **`db_name` property is no longer updatable:** Updating the db_name property results in a destructive
  action as the db is recreated by Terraform. This change fails the update quickly for improved user experience.
