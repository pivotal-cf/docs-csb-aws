**Release Date:** MMMM DD, YYYY

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:

#### Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

- **Removed Amazon ElastiCache for Redis pre-configured plans:**
  From this version onwards, plans are no longer provided with the brokerpak.
  If you have ElastiCache for Redis service instances that you want to maintain that use the formerly built-in plans,
  you must add the plans through the tile configuration.
  For more information, see
  [Previously Provided Pre-configured Plans](reference/aws-redis.html#old-plans) in _Amazon ElastiCache for Redis Reference_.

- **Changes are now applied immediately:**
  From this version onwards, changes made using the `cf update-service` command are applied immediately
  instead of being queued to be applied during the maintenance window.
  This might result in brief downtime while the server reboots.

- **Property <code>cache_size</code> is now deprecated:**
  Consider replacing it with its equivalent `node_type`. [See Table of equivalents for `node_type` and `cache_size`](reference/aws-redis.html.md.erb#cache-size-node-type).
  Notice that specifying `node_type` in a plan prevents any existing or future service from specifying `node_type` as a service-specific configuration parameter.
  This has strong implications for existing plans since existing services might become unmanageable if they specified a custom `node_type` when they were created.
  When in doubt keep using `cache_size` for existing plans and start using `node_type` for any new plans.

  For more information about node types and pricing, see the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/pricing/).
  You can also check: [Choosing your node size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/nodes-select-size.html).


### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### General

- **Increased memory and disk space quota:** This version increases both the broker memory and disk
  quota from 1&nbsp;GB to 2&nbsp;GB to enable a larger number of operations to happen simultaneously.

#### Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

- **`redis_version` is a required user input parameter:**
  From this version onwards, the property `redis_version` is a required user input parameter without a default value. 
  This property is no longer a plan parameter adding more flexibility when creating plans.
  From now on, the `redis_version` is updatable if it has not been defined as a property in a custom plan.
  For more information, see
  [the Amazon ElastiCache for Redis Reference](reference/aws-redis.html) and the 
  [upgrade steps](upgrading.html.md.erb).
- **Encryption of data at rest is enabled by default:**
  New properties `at_rest_encryption_enabled` and `kms_key_id` can be used to control encryption at rest.
