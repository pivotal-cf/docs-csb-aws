### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition services

This release has the following changes for the Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and
Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition services:

- **The preferred maintenance window can be set:**
  New exposed properties to set the preferred maintenance window (see preferred_maintenance_* properties in reference
  section).
  To use the AWS default preferred maintenance window when provisioning, the properties related to the
  preferred maintenance window can all be set to null.

- **Database encryption:**
  By default, all new Aurora clusters are encrypted with an AWS managed encryption key. Alternatively, it's possible to
  provide a custom KMS encryption key ARN, or to disable encryption altogether.

- **`instance_class` property exposed:**
  The `instance_class` property is now configurable at plan creation or instance operations for
  Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition.
  The database instance class determines the computation and memory capacity of an Amazon Aurora
  database instance.
  The database instance class you need depends on your processing power and memory requirements.
  Use `instance_class` to adjust the database instance to your requirements.
  This property is required.
  The `serverless_min_capacity` and `serverless_max_capacity` properties are ineffective without
  setting the `instance_class` property to a valid value for Aurora Serverless v2.
  For information about restrictions associated with the different types of instances
  accepted by Aurora, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html).
