##<a id="1-1-0"></a> v1.1.0

**Release Date:** October 4, 2021

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **Support for encryption of sensitive data:** <%= vars.product_short %> can now encrypt sensitive
data that is provided or genearated during provisioning and binding and stored in the state database.
A key generated from the password you configure in the tile is used for the encryption.
For how to configure encryption, see <a href="installing-with-aws.html#state-db">Configure a State Database</a>.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Use restricted user to connect to CredHub:** The broker uses `cf.uaa.services_credhub_credentials`
instead of `cf.uaa.credhub_admin_client_client_credentials` to communicate with CredHub.
The new credentials have restricted access.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issue:

* **Database failure for terraform workspaces larger then 64K** The database migration will fail if you migrate to this version and there is a 
stored terraform deployment workspace that is larger then 64K in the database. Also, when new terraform deployment workspaces larger then 64K are stored, they will be truncated.

* **PostgreSQL instances cannot be moved to smaller plans:** Because of a limitation with Amazon RDS for
  PostgreSQL, instance plans cannot be changed to smaller plans.
  For example, when using a `cf update-service -p` command.
  This restriction also applies to subsumed PostgreSQL instances.
  Updates to a PostgreSQL instance fail if they attempt an update that decreases `storage_gb`.
  For information about decreasing the total provisioned storage size of an Amazon RDS database instance,
  see the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-db-storage-size/).
