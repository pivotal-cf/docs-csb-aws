**Release Date:** October 4, 2021

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **Support for encryption of sensitive data:** <%= vars.product_short %> can now encrypt sensitive
data that is provided or genearated during provisioning and binding and stored in the state database.
A key generated from the password you configure in the tile is used for the encryption.
For how to configure encryption, see <a href="installing-with-azure.html#state-db">Configure a State Database</a>.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Use restricted user to connect to CredHub:** The broker uses `cf.uaa.services_credhub_credentials`
instead of `cf.uaa.credhub_admin_client_client_credentials` to communicate with CredHub.
The new credentials have restricted access.

### Known Issues

There are no known issues for this release.
