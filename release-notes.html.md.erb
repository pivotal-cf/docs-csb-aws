## <a id="1-9-0"></a> v1.9.0

**Release date:** mmmm dd, 2024

### Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes:


### Features

## Amazon SQS

- **SQS is generally available:** The Amazon SQS service is included in this release and can be used in production.

### Configuration Options for Amazon SQS

A new set of properties enable the configuration of the service.
These configurations include options for both FIFO and Standard queues, Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), encryption settings, and more.

#### General Configuration
- **Queue Type Selection (`fifo`)**:
  Choose between FIFO and Standard queues to optimize message delivery according to your application's needs.
  [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

#### Message Handling
- **Visibility Timeout (`visibility_timeout_seconds`)**:
  Customize the visibility timeout for messages, controlling how long they remain invisible after being retrieved.
  [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

- **Message Retention Period (`message_retention_seconds`)**:
  Define the duration for which Amazon SQS retains a message, allowing for a flexible range from 1 minute to 14 days.
  [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

- **Maximum Message Size (`max_message_size`)**: Set the limit for the size of a message, ranging from 1 KiB to 256 KiB,
  to ensure efficient processing. [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

- **Delivery Delay (`delay_seconds`)**: Implement a delay for message delivery to the queue, facilitating batch
  processing or time-sensitive operations. [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

- **Long Polling Support (`receive_wait_time_seconds`)**: Optimize message retrieval with long polling,
  reducing the number of empty responses. [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

#### Security and Compliance

- **Dead Letter Queue Configuration (`dlq_arn`, `max_receive_count`)**:
  Enhance reliability by specifying a Dead Letter Queue for messages that cannot be processed successfully after a
  certain number of attempts. [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

- **Encryption Settings (`sqs_managed_sse_enabled`, `kms_master_key_id`)**:
  Secure your messages with SQS-managed SSE or specify your AWS KMS customer master key for encryption.
  [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

#### FIFO Specific Configuration

- **Content-Based Deduplication (`content_based_deduplication`)**:
  Simplify message processing in FIFO queues by enabling automatic content-based deduplication.
  [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).

- **Deduplication and Throughput Management (`deduplication_scope`, `fifo_throughput_limit`)**:
  Fine-tune FIFO queue behavior with deduplication scope and throughput limit settings to meet your
  application's performance needs. [Learn more](reference/aws-sqs.html.md.erb#parameters).


### Resolved issues

This release has the following fixes:

- **Broker app memory and disk limitations can now be managed in the tile:**
    You can now control memory and disk quota for the broker app by setting the preferred value in the broker configuration. By default, the quota is set to 2G for both.
    If you have previously made changes to these values outside of the tile, you should propagate those changes in the broker config. The values will then persist through subsequent tile updates.

- **Some RDS MySQL and PostgreSQL instances using gp3 and io1 storage cannot be updated:**
  You can now specify a value of `null` instead of `0` for `iops`. This allows for creation and update of
  instances with `storage_gb < 400GB`.

### Known issues

This release has the following issues:
