#### Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition

This release has the following changes for the Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and
Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition services:

- **Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition are generally available:**
  The Amazon Aurora MySQL and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL services are no longer in beta and can be used
  in production.

- **You can choose a preferred maintenance window:**
  There are new exposed properties to set the preferred maintenance window. For more information, see
  the `preferred_maintenance_*` properties in the [reference topics](reference/index.html.md.erb).
  To use the AWS default preferred maintenance window when provisioning, set all the properties
  related to the preferred maintenance window to null.

- **Database encryption:**
  By default, all new Aurora clusters are encrypted with an AWS-managed encryption key.
  Alternatively, it's possible to provide a custom KMS encryption key ARN, or deactivate encryption
  altogether.

- **`instance_class` property exposed:**
  The `instance_class` property is now configurable at plan creation or instance operations for
  Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition.
  The database instance class determines the computation and memory capacity of an Amazon Aurora
  database instance.
  For more information about `instance_class`, see the [reference topics](reference/index.html.md.erb).
