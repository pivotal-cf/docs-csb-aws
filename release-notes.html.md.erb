New features and changes in this release:

#### Amazon RDS for MSSQL

- **Database encryption:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances are encrypted with an AWS managed encryption key. Alternatively, it's possible to
  provide a custom KMS encryption key ARN, or to disable encryption altogether.
  For more details on encrypting a database instance, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html#Overview.Encryption.Enabling).
  Do not confuse this with [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.SQLServer.Options.TDE.html).

- **Storage autoscaling:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances are created with storage autoscaling disabled.
  Alternatively, it's possible to enable it by setting `max_allocated_storage` to a value greater than `storage_gb` at creation time or by updating the instance.
  For more information check [Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling).

- **Storage type and IOPS:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances use io1 with up to 3000 operations per second (IOPS).
  Alternatively, it's possible to specify different storage type and iops at creation time or modify them after creation.
  For more information check [Amazon RDS DB instance storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html).

  - **Deletion protection:**
  By default, all new MSSQL instances are created with deletion protection disabled.
  Alternatively, it's possible to enable deletion protection at creation time or by updating the instance.
