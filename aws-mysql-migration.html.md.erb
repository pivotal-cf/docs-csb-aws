<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes migrating from Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for
MySQL Instance of the VMware Tanzu Service Broker for AWS tile
to the <%= vars.product_full %> tile.

## <a id='about'></a> About Migrating Data to an Amazon RDS for MySQL Instance

Because the VMware Tanzu Service Broker for AWS (hereafter referred to as the legacy broker) tile
is going out of support, it is important to move from MySQL instances that
were created by the legacy broker over to the <%= vars.product_short %>.

The <%= vars.product_short %> plans are configurable.
When migrating, examine the configuration of the plans in use with the legacy broker and create
matching plans in the <%= vars.product_short %>.

You can use the AWS Data Migration Service (DMS) to migrate data between Amazon RDS for MySQL Instances.
The tool copies data from one database to another.
Because the original database is not modified, you can reverse the migration if you detect any problems.
It also allows migration to happen over time.

The DMS is a tool provided as part of AWS.
For more information about AWS DMS, see the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/).

### <a id='configuration'></a> Matching Configuration

Both the legacy broker and the <%= vars.product_short %> allow you to customize service plans.
Create plans in the <%= vars.product_short %> that match the plans used in the legacy broker.
It may be useful to create a test service instance and compare the properties in the AWS console.
For instructions on how to configure plans, see
[Configure Services with Cloud Service Broker for AWS](installing-with-aws.html#services).

### <a id='migration'></a> Migrating Data

You might want to migrate data from instances created with the legacy broker to instances
created with the <%= vars.product_short %>.

<p class="note important">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Migration of data might incur app downtime.
  The amount of downtime depends on the method chosen.
</p>

There are many options for performing data migration which include [AWS DMS](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/),
manual data migration, and options available from other vendors.
For more information about the data migration process, refer to the documentation for the option that you choose.

In general, the data migration steps are:

1. Create a backup of the MySQL instance.
1. Create an Amazon RDS for MySQL instance using the <%= vars.product_short %>.
1. Replicate the data from a legacy broker MySQL instance into the newly created instance.
1. Unbind apps from the legacy broker MySQL instance and bind them to the newly created instance.
1. After migration is complete, you can stop on-going migration and optionally delete
the legacy broker MySQL instance.

For more detailed steps showing the Cloud Foundry commands necessary to use AWS DMS,
see [Migrate Data from a VMware Tanzu Service Broker for AWS MySQL Instance](#steps).

## <a id='steps'></a> Migrate Data from a Legacy MySQL Instance

To migrate data from an existing legacy MySQL instance to the <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Create a backup of the legacy MySQL instance.

1. Get credentials for the legacy MySQL instance details by running:

    ```console
    cf env APP-USING-LEGACY-SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where is `APP-USING-LEGACY-SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of an app that is bound to a
    service instance from the legacy broker. Inspect the `VCAP_SERVICES` JSON
    output to see the hostname, database, username, password, and port which are required
    to configure DMS.

1. Create a new MySQL service instance using <%= vars.product_short %>.

    ```console
    cf create-service csb-aws-mysql SERVICE-PLAN NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME
    ```

    Where `SERVICE-PLAN` is the name of the MySQL service plan created to match the legacy instance configuration and
    `NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the new MySQL service instance.

1. Create a service key in the new MySQL service by running:

    ```console
    cf create-service-key NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME SERVICE-KEY-NAME
    ```

    Where `NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name of the new MySQL service instance and
    `SERVICE-KEY-NAME` is a name that you choose for the service key.

1. Get credentials from the service key by running:

    ```console
    cf service-key NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME SERVICE-KEY-NAME
    ```

    Inspect the JSON output for the hostname, name, username, password, and port which are required
    to configure data migration.

1. Configure and run data migration, for example, by using AWS DMS.
For how to configure data migration, see the documentation for the process you have chosen.

    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> A data migration process might create schemas and tables without
      granting access for other users to work with that data.
      You can resolve this by connecting to the database using the credentials used for DMS,
      and granting the `binding_user_group` access to the schemas and tables.

      Alternatively, if you are not using continuous migration, for example, AWS DMS Change Data Capture,
      delete the service key used for data migration.
      This re-assigns data ownership to the `binding_user_group` role, automatically
      giving access to other users.
    </p>

1. Disconnect the app from the legacy service binding by running:

    ```console
    cf unbind-service APP-NAME LEGACY-SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where:

    * `APP-NAME` is the app using the MySQL instance.
    * `LEGACY-SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the VMware Tanzu Service Broker for AWS-brokered MySQL instance.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf unbind-service my-app my-old-instance
    </pre>

1. Bind the app to the new service instance by running:

    ```console
    cf bind-service APP-NAME NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where `NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the <%= vars.product_short %> service instance
    that you created in step 2 above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service my-app my-csb-aws-instance
    </pre>

    Because <%= vars.product_short %> creates new credentials at bind time,
    this creates new binding credentials for the app.

1. Update the app to consume the new binding credential format.
The legacy binding exposes the database name in the credentials block as `database`, whereas the
binding credentials received from <%= vars.product_short %> exposes the database name as `name`.
You must update the consuming app to handle the `name` credential property.
     
1. Push and start the app by running:

   ```console
   cf push APP-NAME
   ```

1. After the migration is successful, you can stop continuous migration and remove
the legacy service instance.
